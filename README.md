# Project Name
FinTrack - Personal Finance & Budgeting Platform

# Project Description

FinTrack provides individuals with real-time insights into their spending behavior, helping them create and maintain budgets, monitor their monthly expenses, and earn achievements as they progress toward healthier financial habits.

Users can:

 1) Register and securely manage their financial data
 2) Create, edit, and delete expense records, budget categories, and savings goals
 3) View analytics and charts depicting spending vs. budgets
 4) Earn badges/points when they meet or exceed savings milestones
 5) Receive alerts when they approach budget thresholds or due dates for recurring bills

By incorporating gamification elementsâ€”like levels, badges, and leaderboards, FinTrack not only helps users stay on top of finances but also rewards consistency and progress, making personal finance management more interactive and motivating.
